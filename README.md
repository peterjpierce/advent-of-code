# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions for puzzles from the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).  Just for fun.

## Prerequisites

These solutions require Python 3, but have no external dependencies, so
employing a virtual environment is entirely optional.  If you choose to, and
it exists at `<project_root>/env`, it will be activated automatically
at run time.

## Running Solutions

Use `run` to execute solutions, which establishes the environment
necessary for shared modules and simplifies CLI args.  Call it with
no arguments (or `-h` or `--help` or `help`) to see usage instructions:

```
usage: run [yyyy/]<puzzle>  # defaults to latest year
   ex: run 01a
       run 2017/01a
       run 2017/01a.py
```

*(Note that arguments may take any of the forms shown.)*

## Feedback

These solutions have been tested with Python 3.6.3. Please share feedback and
questions with me at:  peterjpierce@gmail.com
